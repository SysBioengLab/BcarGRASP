# RT-qPCR Data
This folder contains the raw qPCR fluorescence data files obtained from AriaMx equipment (aria_files). These files were processed to obtain the Cq values for each well reaction using the propietary software of the equipment. The reports generated with the results are stored in the aria_reports folder. Both .pdf and .xlsx files are included for visual representations and data as reports. The .xlsx files were used as input to estimate relative transcript quantities. 
During data collection, the following abbreviation nomenclature was utilized to refer to each of the measured gene transcipts:
- a: TAF10
- b: UBC6
- c: CrtYB
- d: CrtE
- e: CrtI
- f: MVD1
- g: HMG1
- h: ACT1
- i: ALG9
- k: ERG9
- l: ERG20
- m: BTS1
- n: IDI1
- o: ERG8
- p: ERG12
- q: HMG2
- r: ERG13
- s: ERG10
