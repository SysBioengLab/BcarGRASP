# Biomass and Metabolites Data
This folder contains the data files used to estimate metabolic fluxes for beta-carotene production models. 
- BiomassConversion.xlsx: (gDCW/L)/OD600nm ratio measurements for each strain by separate
- BiomassMeasurements.xlsx: OD600nm measurements obtained from chemostat cultivations, each sheet is a different experimental condition
- DensityMeanStd.xlsx: assumed density (g/ml) of yeast cells.
- MetabolitesMeasurements.xlsx: measurements of metabolites in each chemostat cultivations. Glucose, ethanol, acetate and glycerol are measurements are in g/L. Lycopene and beta-carotene are in mg/L. Each sheet shows a different metabolite.
- MoistWeightConversion.xlx: assumed moist weight/dry weight conversion factor (g/gDCW) of yeast 
- MolWeights.xlsx: molecular weights of the metabolites
- RPMFluxConversion.xlsx: measurements used to relate RPMs of the feed pump with the feed flow rate (mL/min).
- RPMMeasurements.xlsx: measurements of the RPMs of the feed pump for each of the chemostat cultivations.
