# Kinetic Models
This folder contains additional information for the kinetic models, and the GRASP folder that includes all the necessary information to create the models and utilize them.
## ABC-GRASP
Main folder of the kinetic models, it is equivalent to the GRASP toolbox with added modifications for the specific case of creating the beta-carotene production models. More details are included in the README within it.
## mechanisms
Folder with a .xlsx file with the reaction mechanisms used in the kinetic model.
## thermodynamics
Folder with a .xlsx file with the thermodynamics used in the kinetic model.
